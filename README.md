# CNN-Implementation-Using-Python
Implementation of an ML algorithm - CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) using Python.

WHAT IS CNN?

It is a deep learning algrithm which is commonly used for image processing and recognition.
It proves efficient in dealing with large datasets and its analysis.

The CNN model is inspired from the structure of the brain. The many millions of single cell neurons
constitute and form the brain.

Similarly the smallest single unit of an artificial neural network is called the perceptron and is
used to form single layer and multilayered neural networks.

In mathematics (in particular, functional analysis), convolution is a mathematical operation on 
two functions(say f and g) that produces a third function(f*g) that expresses how the shape of one
is modified by the other. The term convolution refers to both the result function and to the process
of computing it.

Images are nothing but matrix pixel values. CNN can work with both RGB and grayscale images. RGB have
3 planes of matrix pixel values (1 plane for each color) whereas grayscale has only 1 plane, this makes
working with grayscale images easier. 
Technically convolution is done on these pixel matrices and the result is passed on to the other layers
of the neural network.
